TODO:
 - Make a basic wall and player type
 - Make player to wall collision code
 - Make force/movement code

TYPES:
 - Static Object Type (walls)
   - Triangle collision
   - Color
   - Solid, maybe a mask with different groups
   - Texture
 - Player type
   - Rounded rectangle collision
     - x, y, width, height, roundness ratio
   - Needs collision with rectangles and entities
     - Normal direction of collision (perp to the line of collision)
   - Velocity
   - Mass
   - List of all players touching (for wall touch propogation)
     - Include collision direction so it does not need to re-compute
   - Total x and y force for that update cycle
   - JumpOK bool
 - Projectile type
   - circle
 - Other entity type
   - Rectangle
   - Does something on interaction/collision
   
GAMEPLAY UPDATE LOOP
 - Check for input forces
   - including jumps, if jumpOK
 - Check projectiles
   - new projectiles needed (shoot)?
     - Shooting force applied to player
   - Any projectile collisions?
     - do damage to players or entities
 - Check for other forces (projectile to player forces)
   - explosions
 - Check for player-player collisions
   - Transfer momentum directly (update velocity)
   - Update player collision list
 - Check for player-wall collisions
   - Remove all forces in the direction of the collision
   - modify momentum by simulating momentum to an object with infinate mass
   - Propogate out to all players touching (stacked objects)
   - set jumpOK bool (jump can be activated next cycle)
     - Jumps should be conditional on the collision direction
	 - JumpOK should propogate to other players (conditional to collision direction)
   
OTHER NOTES:
 - Use jump, need to calculate if that is OK
 - Need to put more thought into the grapple logic. Will need to work just like collisions
 - Make sure to make input handling scalable to multiplayer
 - Make creative functions for how damage and force from explosions are handled. This will be important for how the game feels
 - There needs to be a maximum velocity and minimum wall size that are related in some way
 - Roller skates for the players? Would feel really good
